# SEISPY

Simplified tools to manage seismic traces  
* Store, filter, manipulate seismic waveforms  
* Visualise array data based on matplotlib collections  
* Very light dependencies : numpy + matplotib
* Save and load seismic data using numpy npz format (system independent)
* No dependency to obspy, although conversion from obspy is handled
